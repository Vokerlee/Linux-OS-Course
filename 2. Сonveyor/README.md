# Conveyor

This program is a model of conveyor in console.

## Istallation and launch

Just print the following after your `git clone`:

```
cd Linux-OS-Course/
cd 2.\ Ð¡onveyor/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./convey test
```

## What happens

Test file should contain conveyor call in console, e. g.:
```
ls -lah \ | grep bin
```

So the program do the same steps as the console does.
